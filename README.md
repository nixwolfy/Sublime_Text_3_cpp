# Sublime_Text_3_for_c++
Through this build you can directly run you C/C++ programmes from sublime.
It allows user input during run time.
It also helps in debugging by showing errors on terminal window as your terminal shows you when you run directly through it.


To use it, go to Tools -> New Build System. Create a file "CPP_RUN.sublime-build". You can now use Ctrl+B to run the build.
